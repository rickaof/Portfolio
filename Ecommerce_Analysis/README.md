# Olist Delivery Delay Prediction 🚚📦

This project analyzes and predicts delivery delays using the Olist Brazilian e-commerce dataset. It covers the full cycle from data exploration to model building and visualization.

## 🔍 Project Steps:
- Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Delay prediction using supervised learning (Scikit-learn)
- SQL queries for dataset understanding
- Interactive dashboards with Power BI

## 📊 Tools & Technologies:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- SQL (joins, aggregations, subqueries)
- Power BI (KPIs, filters, visual reports)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Project Structure
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for each stage
- `sql/` – SQL queries for database analysis
- `images/` – Key charts and visual outputs
- `data/` – Dataset download instructions
- `dashboard/` – Power BI report (PBIX or screenshots)

## 📎 Dataset
This dataset is publicly available via [Kaggle – Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) and contains real sales data from an e-commerce platform in Brazil.
